## 📁 Projects

### 1. [Biodiversity Analysis](codecademy-projects/biodiversity-analysis)
Analyze species data from the National Parks Service. Investigates biodiversity, conservation status, and species distribution using pandas and seaborn.

### 2. [Dataset Cleaning & Basic Visualizations](codecademy-projects/dataset-cleaning)
Clean real-world datasets and create basic visualizations like scatterplots and histograms to explore relationships in the data.

### 3. [SQL + Python A/B Testing](codecademy-projects/SQL-python-ABtest)
Combine SQL queries and Python analysis to simulate and evaluate A/B test experiments. Data is queried live using Codecademy's integrated SQL engine.

### 4. [Visualize Tech Stocks](codecademy-projects/visualize-tech-stocks)
Use the `yfinance` API to download and visualize stock trends of leading tech companies with time series analysis in Python.
